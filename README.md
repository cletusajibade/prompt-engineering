# A Practical Strategy to Upgrade Your Prompts

Here’s how you can use your coding agent to improve your prompt engineering automatically.

This method turns mediocre prompts into powerhouse instructions.


## Step 1: Give Your Agent Full Context

Ensure your coding agent has access to your entire codebase.

Context is leverage.


## Step 2: Use This Meta-Prompt

Copy and paste the prompt below into your coding agent.

Make sure to replace `PASTE_WEAK_PROMPT_HERE` with your original weak prompt.


> **Prompt Template**
>
> Based on your knowledge of this codebase, generate a refined version of the prompt below; rewrite it according to prompt engineering best practices. Structure it in a way that reflects how the best prompts are written today to consistently obtain the highest-quality responses from any LLM coding agent. Do not write any code — only generate the best-performing prompt.

> **Here is my prompt:**

> `<PASTE_WEAK_PROMPT_HERE>`

## Step 3: Deploy the Optimized Prompt

Wait for your coding agent to respond.

Then:

1. Copy the optimized prompt.
2. Use it to instruct your agent to build the feature properly.
